##### I am a Ph.D. student in the Division of the Computational Data Science program at Washington University in St. Louis working with Drs. Deanna Barch and Aris Sotiras. My research interest includes mapping developmental trajectories of psychopathology to better understand biomarkers and predict risk. Towards this end, I am actively building skills in machine learning, longitudinal analysis, and multimodal MRI imaging. When I am not working you can find me on the Reddit boards fighting stock markets wars.
